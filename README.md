# auto-shop
A micro tool for managing materials in an auto-mechanics shop.

This project was written for alt-school's second semester exam.

## Description

auto-shop uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms in Go to create a mini shop
management system for an auto-mechanics distributor. 

## Features

- Check the number of products in the store that are still up for sale
- Add an Item to the store
- List all product items in the store
- Sell an item
- Show a list of sold items and the total price

- Play around with the store methods in `main.go` to simulate how an auto store 
manager will use this project to manage sales and purchases.
